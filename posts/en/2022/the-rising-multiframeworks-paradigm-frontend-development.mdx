# The rise of multiframeworks paradigm in the frontend oss

<PostIntro date='June 26th 2022' category='General' />

Over the last 10 years, we've seen a lot of new general purpose UI libraries / frameworks being built:

- Angular (2010)
- React (2013)
- Vuejs (2014)
- Svelte (2016)
- SolidJS (2021)

Each one of these frameworks brought something new to the table but they are all at the core driven by the concept of UI components.
The frontend ecosystem experimented a lot on this concept of component.
For a while these explorations were tightly coupled with the underlying framework they were built for. For example:

- React: [React Select](https://react-select.com/home), [React Datepicker](https://reactdatepicker.com/)
- VueJS: [Vue Select](https://vue-select.org/), [Vue Datepicker](https://vue3datepicker.com/)

A short while after the concept of [headless ui](https://www.merrickchristensen.com/articles/headless-user-interface-components/) appeared.
A first this concept was very much applied within a framework specific context.
It was much more about building framework specific components flexible enought to easily evolve over time rather than building cross-frameworks components.
But it was a good reminder of the upsides of the separation of concerns in a UI building context. Something that, at the time was a bit forgotten about in favor tightly coupled components.

In parallel, the handling of the state of the component went throught a few iterations and explorations, from basic state utilities built in the frameworks,
to [observables](https://rxjs.dev/), [flux architecture implementation](https://redux.js.org/) and now [full blown state machines](https://xstate.js.org/), all built outside of the frameworks themselves.

The combinaison of these two (headless ui and state handling outside of the UI framework) planted the seed for more decoupling to come in the frontend ecosystem.
Now in 2022, we've seen quite a few "multiframeworks" and / or "framework agnostic" libraries and we are even starting to see a meta-framework go in that direction as well.

## Decoupling at the library level

### UI logic utility

- Zag (React, VueJS, SolidJS)

### UI kits

- Chakra UI
- Headless UI

### Multiframeworks components

Headless + Multiframework (React, Solid, Svelte, Vuejs)

Tan stack

- Query
- Table
- Virtual

AG grid

## Decoupling at the full stack meta framework level

- Remix

## What could this mean ?

- More decoupling -> more reusability
- Potential consolidation of the librarys around a few well supported multiframeworks libs
- Not being multiframeworks may end up being a big "con" in the future of frontend development
- May have some evolution in how we architect our frontend applications, maybe with a more "UI framework agnostic" architecture preference.
- UI frameworks may have less to do as their role will be more focus on UI orchestrations:
  - For example, using Remix make the developer write a lot less React code (less useEffect and others)
  - This could mean the same of others frameworks
