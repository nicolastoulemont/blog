# Leveraging GraphQL Unions to express complexity in a declarative and typesafe way.

<PostIntro date='Apr 27th 2021' category='GraphQL' />

Building and maintaining large applications is, all in all, mostly about managing complexity in a way that make the project easy enough to understand, maintain and improve on.
For a while, it was difficult to express complexity in the API -> client relation. One system would provide data and the other would consume it and each would need to
GraphQL provides a elegant solution to this problem by virtue of its graph schema based approach and union types are a very good tool that graphql provides to express this complexity.
[Sasha Solomon](https://twitter.com/sachee) expressed this very well in her post and subsequent many talks about [200 OK! Error handling in GraphQL](https://sachee.medium.com/200-ok-error-handling-in-graphql-7ec869aec9bc)
