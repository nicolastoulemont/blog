# The Tree

<PostIntro publishedAt="December 23th 2022" categories={["Data Structures"]} />

## What is a Tree ?

A tree is a data structure that represents
a hierarchical structure between a set of connected nodes.
Each node in the tree can be connected to many children (depending on the type of tree),
but must be connected to exactly one parent, except for the root node, which has no parent.

It can have multiple uses, one of the better known are binary trees which enable logarithmic
search operations on the nodes of the tree.

In this post tho, we will focus on building a basic tree data structure, which allow usage
to explore how [Javascript generators functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators#generator_functions)
can help build custom iterators for tree based data structures.

## How to build a Tree in Typescript

Let's start with the building blocks of our tree: the `Node` and `Tree` classes.

### The Tree and Node classes

Our `Node` class will have two properties:

- A `name` to identify it
- `children` to contains its child nodes.

Our `Tree` class will, at first, only have a `root` property that will be the top of our tree.

```tsx
class Node {
  name: string
  children: Node[]
  constructor({ name, children }: { name: string; children: Node[] }) {
    this.name = name
    this.children = children
  }
}

class Tree {
  root: Node | null
  constructor() {
    this.root = null
  }
}
```

Later we will want to add so methods to our `Tree` class to make it useful, probably I/O operations (`get`, `set`, `update`, `remove`).
To be able to perform these operations, a common operation is to traverse our tree from the root to the leafs.

### Tree traversal

In order to easily access all the nodes of our tree, we need a way to iterate over every nodes of the tree.
But since our tree is not a native Javascript array, we cannot use built-in iterators like `forEach`, `for of`, etc.
Let's handle this by building our own custom iterator to handle our specific needs using a [generator function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators#generator_functions).

```tsx
export class Tree {
  root: Node | null
  constructor() {
    this.root = null
  }

  *traverse(node = this.root): Iterable<Node> {
    if (!node) return
    yield node
    if (node.children.length) {
      for (let child of node.children) {
        yield* this.traverse(child)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This generator function is pretty simple, it recursively iterate over every node of the tree, yielding _*("giving")*_ each one back
to the function caller, before moving to each node children until it has yield every leaf of the tree.

### I/O methods

Now that we have a method the easily iterate over our tree, we can add some I/O methods.

#### Set method

In order to set a node to our tree, we have to 2 cases:

- The tree doesn't have a root node yet, in this case their is no need to give the tree a node name to insert the new node into.
- The tree already has a root node, in this case we need to provide an address for the node we need to insert,
  here will use the node name as an address to find where to insert it.

With these two use case in mind, and using our `traverse` function to iterate within our tree, our set function is fairly simple.

```tsx
type IOResult = Node[] | null | undefined
export class Tree {
  root: Node | null
  constructor() {
    this.root = null
  }
  // ...

  set(newNode: Node, parentNodeName?: string): IOResult {
    if (this.root === null) {
      this.root = new Node(newNode)
      return [this.root]
    }

    if (this.root && !parentNodeName) {
      throw new Error("parentNodeName is required once the tree is initialized")
    }

    const inserted: Node[] = []
    for (const node of this.traverse()) {
      if (node.name === parentNodeName) {
        node.children.push(newNode)
        inserted.push(node)
      }
    }

    return inserted.length > 0 ? inserted : undefined
  }
}
```

#### Get method

In order to read a specific node from our tree, we will add a `get` method.
Since our `traverse` function handle the iteration, this one is fairly simple, with only three
possible results:

- There is no root node, meaning that the only possible result is `null`.
- There are one or more nodes with the queries name (we don't restrict the node names to be unique).
  Therefore the result will be an array of nodes `Node[]`.
- There are no matching node, meaning the queried name is `undefined`.

```tsx
type IOResult = Node[] | null | undefined
export class Tree {
  root: Node | null
  constructor() {
    this.root = null
  }
  // ...

  get(nodeName: string): IOResult {
    if (this.root === null) return null
    const results: Node[] = []
    for (const node of this.traverse()) {
      if (node.name === nodeName) {
        results.push(node)
      }
    }

    return results.length > 0 ? results : undefined
  }
}
```

#### Update method

Let's now add an `update` method. It will be very similar to the `set` method, which
in a way is about updating an existing node to add a new child node to it.
To keep it simple, we will keep it's signature to a `boolean` result, but we could
have an array with the updated nodes instead if we wanted to.

```tsx
type IOResult = Node[] | null | undefined
export class Tree {
  root: Node | null
  constructor() {
    this.root = null
  }
  // ...

  update(nodeName: string, updatedNode: Partial<Node>): IOResult {
    if (this.root === null) return null
    const updated: Node[] = []
    for (const node of this.traverse()) {
      if (node.name === nodeName) {
        Object.assign(node, updatedNode)
        updated.push(node)
      }
    }
    return updated.length > 0 ? updated : undefined
  }
}
```

#### Remove method

Finally let's enable the tree users to remove nodes from the tree.
This one is has a caveat because in order to remove a node we need to do two things:

- Find it
- Lift its children nodes to its parent node in order to avoid removing more nodes than one.

In order to do, we will iterate over our nodes to find to find the target node when reaching its parent node.
We will then do the following:

- Hold a reference to the target node
- Remove it from its parent children node array
- Adds the target node children nodes to its parent children nodes array

```tsx
type IOResult = Node[] | null | undefined
export class Tree {
  root: Node | null
  constructor() {
    this.root = null
  }
  // ...

  remove(nodeName: string): IOResult {
    if (!this.root) return null
    const removed: Node[] = []
    for (const node of this.traverse()) {
      const foundChildNode = node.children.find(({ name }) => name === nodeName)
      if (foundChildNode) {
        removed.push(foundChildNode)
        node.children = node.children.filter(({ name }) => name !== nodeName)
        node.children.push(...foundChildNode.children)
      }
    }
    return removed.length > 0 ? removed : undefined
  }
}
```

That's it for this basic tree !

To conclude, we can see that a generator function can be a very useful abstraction over a
a custom iteration process. It has allowed us separe the iteration from the I/O itself
and keep our code simple and clean.
