# How to build a datepicker from scratch

_*With nice animations and gesture support for mobile users*_

<PostIntro publishedAt="November 19th 2022" categories={["React", "Animations"]} />

Firstly, you should probably not build one from scratch and use an open source one ([Material UI](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/getting-started/), [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-picker/)) as building a datepicker is fairly complicated and with some edge cases.

Secondly, to give credits where they're due, the datepicker we're gonna build has been inspired in some ways by [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-picker/) on the **technical side** and on the **design side** by the datepicker I have been building at my day job _*(I'm a design system engineer at the moment)*_ with the help of [Sylvie NGuyen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ssilbing/).
We're still goint to build something a little different tho !
