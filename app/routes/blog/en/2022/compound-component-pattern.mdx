# The compound component pattern

_*A flexible component authoring pattern to give consumers a flexible composition based API*_

<PostIntro publishedAt="December 18th 2022" categories={["React", "Architecture"]} />

Compound components are component that share a common context to work together to perform one or more given task(s).
They work by exposing a declarative API leaving the consumer compose them to achieve their goal.
This is in contrast to components with an imperative API that usually require more extensive configuration properties to
then handle their task internally.

## What we're going to build

<Container>
  <AccordionDemo />
</Container>

Which has the following API

```tsx
function AccordionDemo() {
  return (
    <Accordion.Root>
      <Accordion.Header>
        Header content
        <Accordion.Icon />
      </Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Panel>Panel content</Accordion.Panel>
    </Accordion.Root>
  )
}
```

## A shared common context

### Concept

### React implementation

## Small single purpose components

### Header

### Icon

### Panel

## Conclusion

### Pros

### Cons
